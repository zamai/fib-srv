Web Backend Technical Challenge
===============================
Please design and implement a web based API that steps through the Fibonacci sequence. 

The API must expose 3 endpoints that can be called via HTTP requests:
* current - returns the current number in the sequence
* next - returns the next number in the sequence
* previous - returns the previous number in the sequence

Example:
```
current -> 0
next -> 1
next -> 1
next -> 2
previous -> 1
```

Requirements:
* The API must be able to handle high throughput (~1k requests per second).
* The API should also be able to recover and restart if it unexpectedly crashes.
* Assume that the API will be running on a small machine with 1 CPU and 512MB of RAM.
* You may use any programming language/framework of your choice.
